## Next word prediction app

This is an word prediction app presentation. 
This app takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.

## Data

We use the SwiftKey database including 3 text files, which are blogs, news and twitter. We only use the English version.

- en_US.blogs.txt: 899288 lines, 38004083 words
- en_US.news.txt: 1010242 lines, 35537939 words
- en_US.twitter.txt: 2360148 lines, 30997636 words

Since the 3 text files are large, we trained 1% of the data.


## How to use the app

In the app, please type in the word(s) you would like to predict in the left panel box, the most popular five word(s) will pop up in the right panel.
